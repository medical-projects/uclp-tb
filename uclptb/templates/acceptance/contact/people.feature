As a User
I need to record the contact details, some demographics of Contacts
So that I can follow up with them and make sure they get tested for TB

Given that I am on the Contact Tracing pathway
Then I should be able to enter the contact details and relationship of TB contacts

Given that I am on the Contact Tracing pathway
When I have already entered information about one person
Then I should be able to enter the details about further people from the same screen
